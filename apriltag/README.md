Running
=======

You can run `aprilag_opencv_demo` to do stuff, run with `-h` to get help.

So for example, you can run

    ./apriltag_opencv_demo -B    ../images/mapping_feb_2014/*.JPG
    ./apriltag_opencv_demo -B -c ../images/mapping_feb_2014/*.JPG

to benchmark the new code against the old code.
